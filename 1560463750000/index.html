  <h1>Kawhi to Raptors, DeRozan to Spurs</h1>
  <p>
    How the <i>fuck</i> did this happen? Toronto, the 6ix, the "can never get a superstar" has a superstar.
  </p>

  <p>
    To all Raptors fan who this this was the worst decsion made by the management, I humbly tell you, you're dumb. Don't get in your feelings. Relax.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's the backstory. Kawhi Leonard, easily top 5 NBA player currently playing, has made it clear to everyone he wants to be with LeBron in LA. So much so that he walked away from a five year max contract worth <b>$219 million dollars</b>. Next year, Kawhi becomes a free agent, which means he has the ability to choose where he wants to play. Essentially, every team gives him a sales ptich for their Toyota Corolla ass team but instead he chooses a Lamborghini. He drives it to Hollywood and parks his car at the Lakers. Spurs and the great Popovich know that they're no Lamborghini. So, rather trade Kawhi now and get some assets in return than get <i>nothing</i> next year when he's a free agent. Spurs called up every team and got rejected. No team wants to give up their assets for a player who's only going to be a one year rental.
  </p>

  <p>Is that seriously your argument? Masai Ujiri is bringing out his inner Kanye and telling you, "you don't got the vision Sway!" Let's be honest here, Raptors, at best, are just contenders for Eastern Conference Semi-Finals with DeRozan (and aging Lowry). They are <b>NOT</b> winning a championship with DeRozan. You know this, I know this. So, let me ask you again, what good is it to keep DeRozan? I would rather grow a pair of balls, put all the chips on the table and gamble on Kawhi. Raptors desperately need a roster change. If Kawhi stays, we can attract better players and improve our roster. If Kawhi leaves, we start rebuilding our roster. It’s an inevitable change that needed to happen, so I’d rather take Kawhi in the process.

    Welcome to the Raptors Kawhi. Ball out.
