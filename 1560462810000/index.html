  <h1>Seamless Technology Is Underrated</h1>
  
  <p>
    This is a rather simple thought. I was driving down to class this morning when I remembered a conversation I had with my friend yesterday. He said he would love to get an Apple watch. He argued that it would drop his phone usage, save him time and let him focus on tasks at hand. Initially, you may think this is silly. The aggregate time saved is probably less than 10 minutes in the entire day. The difference in time between looking at your Apple watch vs. pulling out your phone may just be 5 seconds or less.

    I thought about it, I believe there is a bigger picture to be seen. Having an Apple watch on your wrist will make the information you receive via your mobile phone very seamless. Technology that is integrated in the backend of your life is worth having. This type of technology is underrated because it lacks your attention since it was designed so that the interaction between you and technology is natural and seamless.

    Take for example, keyless car entry. As long as the car keys are on you somewhere when you open the door of your car, it will unlock. You’re not actively thinking about finding your car keys to open your door as you approach your car. Usually, you’re touching yourself all over just to find that the car keys were in your back pocket the whole time. This seamless process of keyless car entry doesn’t break the flow you were in. As you are walking to your car having a conversation with either yourself or your friends, you carry that flow through the door into the car without any interruptions.

    In this sense, having an Apple watch is quite similar. Having all your phone notifications available on your wrist will definitely increase your focus. The vibrations you feel from notifications on your wrist will stop you from checking your phone constantly in case you’ve missed something. Seeing information immediately on your wrist is definitely more natural and seamless than having to pull out your phone.

    In conclusion, having thought about these technologies 5 minutes longer than usual I found an appreciation for them that I didn’t have before. Now, I definitely want an Apple watch.
